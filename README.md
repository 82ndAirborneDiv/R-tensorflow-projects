# R Tensorflow Examples
Sean Browning  

Some basic experimentation with syntax and visualization of Tensorflow runs in R.
Inspired by [Nick McClure's Tensorflow Cookbook](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook)

## Projects:

- Simple MLP network classifying two enclosed circles  
- Simple MLP network classifying the Iris dataset
- linear and Kernel SVM classifying the Iris dataset
- `make_circles()` and `make_spheres()` helper functions
